# Open-Source-Wearables

This project is meant to act as an open library of wearable components, techniques, or research related to wearing technology. This is a personal repository that I am using to organize my thoughts, but I want for my work to be used and built upon. Choose MIT or Apache2 for licensing and just attribute Pipeargill if you find anything useful in your project.

### Project Overview  

The first goal of this project is to develop a modular wearable system starting with the 3M 6000 Series Respirator Masks.  

![20241205_002423](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14851dcb-9b65-45dc-87be-e97fc3cf0171)

Respirator masks offer a versatile platform for building cosplay helmets and fursuit heads because they can be attched to easily, fit securely, and come with useful benefits..like filtering air. I’ve discovered that wearing a respirator mask, especially for seasonal allergies, is not only more comfortable than taking allergy medications but gives me an awesome opportunity for expression.

![20241205_002525](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd5dd993-fc13-41a3-9461-2a94155eefbc)

The respirator masks are relitively affordable, fairly comfortable, feature an anti-fog exhaust port, and have adjustable straps that can easily be replaced. The aim of this project is to create modular adapters and accessories that allow the creation of custom cosplay, fursuit, cyberwear, or prosthesis designs that can be easily attached to the mask.

## Cyberwear  
This category is for functional parts that add to a wearable's functionality or act as some sort of usability aid or prosthesis. Think anything from lights and sounds to standing support, digilegs, or wearable information and computer systems.

## Cosplay  
This category is for parts and techniques related to turning 3D designs into wearables. Think hard shell armor and character faces printed directly.

## Fursuit  
This category is for parts and techniques related to turning character concepts into wearables that utilize a fabric, textile, or faux-fur outer layer.

## Utility/Tactical
This category is for anything that has a specific functon other than looking cool.

## Solutions
This category is a catch-all for components that adapt one thing to another, hold a thing in a place, or otherwise solve a problem or adapt one category into another.

## Toolbox  
This category is for relief cuts or other tools.

### Current Development  

I am currently working on 3D modeling adapters that allow the respirator mask to be attached. I have one adapter almost ready for beta and a few more in development. The long-term goal is to make the system modular to allow users to easily swap parts based on their design needs or to easily relief cut their own 3D design into a compatible part for this system.  

#### Remote Air Supply  

Adapter set almost ready for beta!
v0.3 12/24/24

The first use case will be fitting the mask under my MTB full face helmet and attaching the remote filters somewhere. I've already test fitted the 3M half mask respirator under the helmet with the low profile adapters, I just need to film and document and do all the publishing junk.

These adapters seem expensive for no good reason.  

![449N09_AS01](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ae01796-2914-4c70-8d7e-cb7c2137baa8)


This is a low-profile adapter to allow air supply connections that can fit under a mask. I am considering it a Solutions part and it will be a base component for many other designs that will fall into other categories. It attaches to 5 0.25in/7mm rubber hoses and connects to the corresponding part that holds the filter. This opens to opportunity to inject oxygen or various medications into the airstream and could help those with breathing complications, especially in active settings.

#### S-1 Beta 0.4 beta

![20241220_141300](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/645a9185-50a4-4293-a1ff-043a1e5d5381)

I have disignrd the corresponding part that will connect to the filter and allow for remote placement, just need to document and publish.

## Research into molecular geomety

After seeing Crash Makerspace's video on using resin 3D printed structures, I started really thinking about this problem in my idle time.  I read comments by @erokfussell that go back and forth a bit with @CrashMakerspace and decided to try to understand more about these structures. I really appreciated this video for explaining the concepts in a way that was approachable to the way I understand materials and force and I appreciate the scientific approach and willingness to share knowledge.

I looked around a bit and found a model that was very interesting because it was a lattus structure nested within another lattus structure. [Duble-Diamond mutual structure - Bulagen](https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-duble-diamond-mutual-structure-17925)

Here is a spacing experiment I tried using this structure as a guide.

<img width="249" alt="Capture9" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5bfac85-b21c-4c57-b45a-6b9b0582bfde" />

The idea of a double lattuce structure is interesting because it could allow for nodes of the lattuce to be less effected for the rapidly moving shockwave that travels through the material, or by varying the size of the tabs that connect lattuce A to lattuce B while nested togeather, the force could be redirected into "unzipping" the 2 structures. This is purely conjecture and I am probably not going to test printed copies of these structures at this point. I've found it challenging to work with this sort of structure in Fusion 360 but I like that and I may approach this again once I have more than 12GB of RAM and everything stops freezing.
<img width="641" alt="Capturelol" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12dedeb5-09c7-420a-8fab-fd41bb4fd8f1" />

Here is a layout of how I was attempting to pattern the nodes out of bodies after generating a lattus structure.

Here is an example of how these structures can nest

<img width="442" alt="Double" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32d2a1b8-09c1-413c-8f9f-1a991ea04919" />

Another view, from here you can see some space because the nesting I manually arranged isn't centered.

<img width="497" alt="Capture44" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/660b4ba5-66cb-4c43-a3bd-34da4bb097f0" />

Tripple nested, these nodes are very close togeather

One last video I want to leave this idea with that could be useful because it showcases several structures, I'm unfamilure with this software otherwise:
[What is lattice structure - Innogrit 3D](https://youtube.com/shorts/OYSQpLlBmEs?si=5Nqu5sfW5F0YzJVN)


*1 I am including my STEP files for this research under MIT or Apache2, the only thing close to an origional idea here is my idea of utalizing a double nested molecular diamond structure in balistic testing. This idea remains unproven.

*2 I utalized CrashMakerspace's 20mm resin print file purely for research purposes by getting a general scale for the structures being worked with. Their IP is their own and I am not redistributing those files.

*3 Duble-Diamond mutual structure by Bulagen is Licensed MyMiniFactory - Credit - Remix - Noncommercial
I am including a copy in one of my files as refrence, this copy is unaltered and not attached physically or by symbolic relationship to any other objects in that file and should not change the MIT or Apache2 status of the other objects in that file, which I own and share under MIT or Apache2. I am not a lawyer.

### Next Actions

- **Documentation on 18v power supply**: I utilize Ridgid 18v drill packs because they have a low voltage cutoff that is useful. I don't recommend DeWalt 20v batteries without a controller board because they can be ran down to 0v.
I'm using adapter plates that I bought, but I can design out some printed ones that use male spade connections to interface with the batteries. I've found a 12/24v USB/C marine adapter that works great with 16-22v or whatever drillpacks are. There's also a neat 3A buck/boost converter that I've found that could also be useful.

- **Motorcycle/MTB Helmet Integration**: A version that works with a full-face helmet on top of a half mask.

- **Red Hood/Power Rangers/Kamen Rider helmet base**
This is a challenge I want to tackle early on as a way to push this design. It should be easy to fit a respirator mask under a big head, but I want to try to produce a very low profile design so that these sorts of helmets are possible. This will utilize the remote filter adapters I'm almost ready with.


### Future Ideas
  
- **Transhumanist Stillsuit**: With a focus on adapting to air quality concerns, this suit aims to normalize mask-wearing in everyday life with potential for oxygen or inhaler supply.
  
- **Mobility Support**: Features focused on user needs such as standing, walking, or wheelchair/mobility aid adapters.
  
- **Electronic Integrations**: Future designs will incorporate electronics like heads-up displays, lights, external displays, speakers, fans, ect.
  
- **Meshtastic/Radio**: Embedding comms systems.
  
- **Wide View Periscopes**: For TV head/Foreverwinter digital shaman design. May end up doing a video feed, but I want to experiment with mirrors a bit here.
  
- **Dissect a used camera with a digital viewfinder for digital periscope**: Find common enough model
  
- **Space Marine/Zaku/Jin Roh Suit**: Focus on larger/bulky armored cosplay base.  
- **Tactical/Utilitarian Suit**: A base focused on practical use over form.
  
- **Ballistics**: Use of embedded printed structures that help resist bullet impacts—explore molecular geometries such as diamond, double diamond, graphene, and variations on these structures.

- **TV Head Prince Robot IV**: TV head character that I plan to cosplay, which should make a good base design.

- **Puppet Head on Long Neck**: I want to try this as a way to add more articulation to a head that is puppeted on top of the user's head.

#### Proof of Concept - Test Print 1 (12/1/24)  

![20241201_193228](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fa09887-2368-43ce-a3f5-a60393812566)  

**First Prototype Notes**  
The first prototype was a simple test design to see how the 3D print would attach to the exhaust port of the respirator mask.  

- **Prototype**: Horse skull adapter for 3M 6200 half-mask respirator.  
- **Objective**: Test fit, angle adjustment, and clearance.  
- **Result**: Mostly a failure, but it was able to be mounted and allowed me to measure how far I was off.

### Philosophy & Goals

I am putting this at the end because it is both the most and least important part of this. Uncontrollable yapping follows:

Wearing a mask of any kind is unavoidably political in the United States and in many other places, so for many people simply protecting themselves and surviving in public is an act of resistance. 
This project is born out of a personal need to filter pollen while being active, particularly while mountain biking. My alergies are bad and medically relavent, but my needs are minor compaired to what that of my friends and people I've known. The risk of losing the freedom to cover our face and protect our bodies is real and it is terrifying for the immunocompromised folk. [Some More News - Mask Bans](https://youtu.be/XTNBMVoFqN8?si=kvrvwtuGsiLRsKs5)

Respirators like the 3M 6000 series offer better face comfort compared to disposable dust masks and keep hot air off the face, and I aim to build on that technology for broader and more creative daily use.

Face recognicion means that we are increasingly carrying our identifcation papers on our face, and banning masks at protests insures that the ability to protest without being doxxed and harassed will be vanishing. 
Privacy as a fundamental human right, recognized in Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)

I believe in promoting the normalization of mask-wearing in society, not just for protection but as a form of self-expression. With growing concerns about pollution, microplastics, and airborne diseases, wearable filters will become more important for our collective future. By developing open, modular, and functional headgear, I hope to support a creative outlet for the community and help others embrace volentary personal protection in more contexts.

An extremely important note to make is that for many people mask wearing and protecting one's body are extremely important religious and cultural rights that should not be disrespected, appropreated, or the expression of suppressed.
Here is a list:

Christianity:
1 Corinthians 6:19-20: “Your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit... therefore honor God with your bodies.”

Exodus 34:29-35 (The Bible): Moses veils his face after descending from Mount Sinai because his face shines from speaking with God. Many modern Christians speak with God regurally, and are often called to action by God. They would be following Moses' tradition by covering their face.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many churches referenced Leviticus 13:45-46, which outlines isolation and covering the mouth of individuals with contagious conditions, as biblical support for mask-wearing.

Judaism:

Isaiah 6:2: Describes seraphim covering their faces in the presence of God, which can symbolize reverence and humility.

Masks and costumes are central to Purim celebrations, expressing joy and creativity in a religious context.

Buddhism:

Dhammapada 231-233: “One should guard oneself... Protect your body, for it is the vehicle of your spirit.” This emphasizes taking care of one’s body, which can extend to wearing masks for health or ritual purposes.
    
Buddhist monks and practitioners in some traditions wear face coverings (e.g., in Japan and Korea) to protect life, reflecting the principle of Ahimsa (non-harm).

Sikhism:

Guru Granth Sahib: “Body and mind belong to the One who owns the soul... Preserve the self in purity.” (SGGS, Ang 727). Sikh teachings emphasize maintaining health and cleanliness as part of spiritual discipline.

Taoism:

Tao Te Ching 50: “He who protects his body as sacred has found his purpose.”

Hindu:

In Hindu traditions, masks are often used in performances like Kathakali or Ramayana reenactments, symbolizing deities and characters.

Shinto:

Masks are worn in traditional rituals to represent kami (spirits) and protect participants in sacred spaces from impurity.

Indigenous Spiritualities:

Masks play a significant role in Native American, Australian Aboriginal, African, and other indigenous ceremonies. They are worn for expression, storytelling, and connecting with the spiritual world. Many of these traditions have been lost but if anyone would like to share specific examples please reach out to me.

This is not an exaustive list and I am not an expert, but there is enough information here to show that determining if an individual's reasion for wearing a mask is either religion or medical is an impossible task without legally enguaging with them, which authorities often will not have cause to do. This information is here to help protect the public and give aid to those who wish to challenge unjust or unconstitutional laws in the United States. I make no warrenties, do your own research. I am not a lawyer, I am a silly clown person who says silly thing.
